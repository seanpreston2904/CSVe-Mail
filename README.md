# CSVe-Mail
## What is it?
CSVe-Mail (pronounced "Cee-Ess-Vee-Mail") is a tool for batch generating E-mail handles from .CSV files. This project was inspired by a Systems Administrator, and close friend of mine who sought out such a tool for generating E-mail addresses for students, as opposed to doing it by hand.

This tool is extremely early in development, and is nowhere near fully featured. But keep checking back for updates and new releases.
